[Filter]
# Not all filters are applied to the X-Plane compilation and none to the DFD compilation.
#
# If include filter is set only the listed features are loaded
# If exclude is set all listed features as excluded
# Exclude has priority before include
# All filters are case insensitive, comma separated and use globbing expressions
# ?	Matches any single character
# *	Matches zero or more of any characters
# [...]	Sets of characters can be represented in square brackets

# If scenery is covered by this filter it will be but at the end of the loading list i.e. get highest priority
