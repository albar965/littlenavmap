Little Navmap
=============

Little Navmap is a free open source flight planner, navigation tool, moving map, airport search and
airport information system for Flight Simulator X, Prepar3D and X-Plane.

A widely configurable map display using the OpenStreetMap as a background map is only one option
of many online or included offline maps.

Navigraph provides updates for all navigation data. A cycle 1707 database is included.

It supports approach and departure procedures, offers several automatic flight plan calculation options
and multiple export formats like GFP, GPX, RTE, FLP and FMS as well as drag and drop
flight plan editing on the map.

An elevation profile is shown for the flight plan allowing to find a safe cruise altitude.

Search functionality allows to look for airports, navaids or procedures by a large amount of
criteria also including a spatial search.

The program can generate an route description string from flight plans and vice versa.

Little Navmap supports FSX, FSX Steam Edition, Prepar3d Versions 2, 3, 4 and X-Plane

-- INSTALLATION --------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The installation of Little Navmap does not change any registry entries (in Windows) and involves a simple
copy of files therefore an installer or setup program is not required.

Do not extract the archive into the folder "c:\Program Files\" or "c:\Program Files (x86)\" since this
requires administrative privileges for some Windows versions. Windows keeps control of these folders,
therefore other problems might occur like replaced or deleted files.

Extract the Zip archive into a folder like "c:\Little Navmap". Then start the program by
double-clicking "littlenavmap.exe". See online manual for more information on the first start after installation.

In some cases you have to install the MS Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable package
(https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=40784). Install both 32 and 64 bit versions.
Usually this is already installed since many other programs require it.

See the online manual if installing for other Simulators than FSX SP2.

I recommend to delete all installed files of a previous Little Navmap version before installing a new version.
All files from the previous ZIP can be deleted since settings are stored in separate directories
except custom map themes. In any case do not merge the installation directories.

See the online manual for more information about configuration and database files. Do not delete these.

Little Navmap is a 32-bit application and was tested with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 (32-bit & 64-bit).

The installation on Linux and macOS computers is simlar except different paths.
