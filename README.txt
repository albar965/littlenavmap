Little Navmap is a free open source flight planner, navigation tool, moving map, airport search and
airport information system for Flight Simulator X, Prepar3D, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020,
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and X-Plane.

A widely configurable map display using the OpenStreetMap as a background map is only one option
of many online or included offline maps.

Navigraph provides updates for all navigation data. A cycle 1801 database is included.

It supports approach and departure procedures, offers several automatic flight plan calculation
options and multiple export formats like GFP, GPX, RTE, FLP and FMS as well as drag and drop flight
plan editing on the map.

An elevation profile is shown for the flight plan allowing to find a safe cruise altitude.

Search functionality allows to look for airports, navaids or procedures by a large amount of
criteria also including a spatial search.

The program can generate an route description string from flight plans and vice versa.

Little Navmap supports FSX, FSX Steam Edition, Prepar3d Versions 3, 4, 5, Microsoft Flight
Simulator 2020, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, X-Plane 11 and X-Plane 12.
