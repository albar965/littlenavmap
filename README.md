## Version 2.2.4 Features

* *Little Navmap* is a **free** open source flight planner, navigation tool, moving map, airport
  search and airport information system.
* Supported platforms: **Windows 7/8/10, macOS \(10.10 or newer only\) and Linux \(64 bit only\)**.
* Support for **Flight Simulator X, Flight Simulator - Steam Edition, Prepar3D v2, v3, v4 and
  X-Plane 11 \(64 bit\)**.
* Comes with the following user interface languages: **Dutch, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Spanish, Italian and German**
  (Spanish and Italian being work in progress).
* All is based on flight simulator stock or add-on data, no third party data needed. All stock and
  add-on airports are loaded in a few minutes.
* **Navigation data can be updated from [Navigraph](http://www.navigraph.com/). A cycle 1801 database
  courtesy of navigraph is included in the download and includes navaids, airways, airspaces and procedures**.
* Navigation database updates by [fsAerodata](https://www.fsaerodata.com) and [FSX/P3D Navaids
  update](https://www.aero.sors.fr/navaids3.html) are supported. Support for X-Plane navdata updates
  and user defined waypoints.
* Can read airspaces in OpenAir format for X-Plane and FSX or Prepar3D airspaces can be copied into
  the X-Plane database.
* Uses X-Plane stock and updated navdata for approach, SID and STAR procedures including
  transitions.
* It features a detail rich **navigation map** that partially uses symbols from real VFR maps thus
  transporting a large amount of information. Multiple offline maps, online map themes
  ([OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), [OpenTopoMap](https://opentopomap.org),
  [OpenMapSurfer](http://korona.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/) and more) and two map projections are
  available. Several map themes provide **hill shading** as well as display of the **sun shadow** on the globe.
* **Quick modifier mouse clicks** in map allow fast actions.
  E.g. `Ctrl+Click` to start measurement or `Shift+Click` to place range rings.
* The map shows user and **AI aircraft as well as ships**, airports, **airport maps** (runway
  details, overrun areas, displaced thresholds, taxiways and more), VOR, VORTAC, TACAN, NDB, ILS,
  waypoints, airways, airspaces, approach and departure procedures, airport weather symbols and
  minimum off-route altitude grid.  Plenty of information is available in tooltips or information windows
  for each map object.
* **Flight plans** and flight plan fragments can be loaded, saved and merged all using the common
  Flight Simulator PLN files as well as **X-Plane FMS format version 3 and 11**, FSC and FLP files.
* Flight plans can be exported to the **_Reality XP GNS 530W/430W V2_, the _Reality XP GTN 750/650 Touch_ and
  the _Flight1 GTN 650/750_**.
* More export formats are **GPX (GPS Exchange Format, including flown track), PMDG RTE, FLP, X-Plane
  FMS 3 and 11, Majestic Dash FPR and many more**. FS9 PLN and FSC plans can be imported.
* **Drag and drop** flight plan editing functionality on the map allows to easily create and edit
  plans.
* Several fast **automatic flight plan calculation** modes are available to create plans following
  airways or simply from radio navaid to radio navaid within a split second. No online service is
  needed for flight plan calculation.
* Option to **calculate flight plan fragments** between any two waypoints of a present flight plan.
* Flight plan route descriptions can be read which allows to convert flight plans from and to **ATS
  route descriptions** which can be retrieved from the various online services like
  [RouteFinder](http://rfinder.asalink.net) or [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com). This includes
  SIDs, STARs and information for cruise speed and altitude.
* **Aircraft performance, fuel planning** top of climb and top of descent calculation considering aircraft performance
  and altitude restrictions in procedures is available.
* A zoom and scrollable **elevation profile** window shows the **ground elevation** along the flight plan
  including the minimum safe altitude for the whole plan or each segment as well as **procedure altitude restrictions**.
* The map and flight plans including all related information at departure and destination can be **printed**.
* A fast **airport and navaid search** allows to look for objects by an unimaginable amount of
  options also featuring a spatial search to find nearest airports.
* **Information windows** display numerous details about airports, runways, COM frequencies,
  approach and departure procedures, navaids, the user aircraft, AI or multiplayer aircraft as well
  as ships, **decoded weather** from multiple sources like X-Plane, AS16, Active Sky Next, Active Sky
  for Prepare3D v4, NOAA, VATSIM and IVAO. **Sunrise and sunset** for airports is shown in information as well
  as bearing and distance to user aircraft.
* The map display and the measurement units (nautical, metric, imperial) can be customized by the
  user.
* User interface and map display can be further customized by changing configuration files and SVG icons.
* All settings, search parameters, current flight plan, map positions and much more are saved
  between sessions.
* *Little Navmap* can connect directly to the flight simulator, the *Little Xpconnect* X-Plane
  plugin and can also be run stand-alone or in **networked configuration**.
* Complete functionality for **user defined waypoints**. Add, edit (also bulk-edit), delete, search, move and display.
  Allows to create custom categories and icons. Import and export of CSV, X-Plane and Garmin files.
* Optionally creates logbook entries in userdata for each takeoff and landing.
* **Can display IVAO, VATSIM and custom online networks centers and clients on map, tooltips and information windows.<br/>_IVAO is currently disabled due to missing clearance.
  Need volunteers to run a mirror._**
* **Compass rose** for map or user aircraft showing heading, track and distances.
* Customizable **airport traffic patterns** can be shown for any airport.
* An **automatic reconnect** option makes the start order of programs irrelevant. Running a
  networked setup needs the included [Little Navconnect](littlenavconnect.html) program which eases
  setup across two or more computers.
* The program does not consume a lot of resources and can be run on **low end computers**.
* **User interface styles** (also `Night`) can be changed on the fly without restart.
* **Help** is available online \(can be downloaded as PDF, ePub or Mobi\). A PDF file with the
  complete manual is included with the program. Help buttons in dialogs link to corresponding online
  help chapter.
* The program can check for updates on three different channels \(stable, beta and develop\) and
  will show a notification if a new version is available. Configurable in options dialog.
